# 📱 Mobile Development Projects 📱

These are some cross-platform mobile projects that I am currently building while introducing myself to React Native as a developement framework!

Todos (GoodEats) :

1. Find useable API to replace mock restaurant data ⭐⭐⭐ (currently working on: Yelp Fusion + positionstack geocoding)
2. Set up Jest with Expo and write a mock unit test.
3. Resdesign the "settings" interface
