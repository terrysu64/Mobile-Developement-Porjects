# 📱 Mobile Development Projects 📱

These are some cross-platform mobile projects that I am currently building while introducing myself to React Native as a developement framework!

Todos:

1. Find useable API to replace mock restaurant data ⭐⭐⭐
2. Update "favorites" feature to Firebase (I'm working on rn)
3. Set up Jest with Expo and write a mock unit test.
4. Resdesign the "settings" interface
